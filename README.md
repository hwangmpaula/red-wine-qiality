# Explore-and-Summarize-Data

This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. 
At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

# Guiding Questions:

Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?

##### The Goal to Complete the project:
  
  - Answers to the questions
  - Code to solve the problems 
  - Comments when necessary

##### Another Files in Explore-and-Summarize-Data:

  - "red_wine.Rmd" documents with R Markdown and R codes 
  - "wineQualityInfo.txt" is the file written in text, would help indicate the variables (based on physicochemical tests) 
  - "wineQualityReds.csv" files that consists of data and used as to data analyzation
### 

##### Explore-and-Summarize-Data uses some open source projects to work properly:

* [R] -  is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
* [Rstudio] - uses to facilitate the data analyzation by displaying the plots
